title: "AI - ElevenLabs Webhook"
api: "POST /v1/elevenlabs/webhook"
authMethod: "key"
---

Handle webhook notifications from ElevenLabs for voice synthesis.

<Note>
  This is the only AI endpoint that uses the `x-roomi-token` key auth in the playground.
</Note>

This is not used to POST to Elevenlabs, but is used to give the Elevenlabs agents access to Roomi AI.
